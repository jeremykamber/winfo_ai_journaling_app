Today was… *fine*. Work dragged on forever—I swear my inbox refills itself the second I hit “send.” But hey, I finally fixed that bug in the project code. Small victories. Stopped by the grocery store after work and impulse-bought a fancy candle that smells like “midnight rain.” It’s just lavender, let’s be real. Later, my neighbor’s cat, Mr. Whiskers, camped outside my window and yowled until I gave him tuna. I’m not his human, but here we are. Tried a new pasta recipe. Burnt the garlic. Ate it anyway.

Met Lena for lunch at that new ramen spot downtown. She’s planning a solo trip to Iceland and talked nonstop about glaciers. I’m equal parts jealous and terrified of her courage. Spent the afternoon reading in the park until a squirrel stole my granola bar. The audacity! Finished the day rewatching *Parks and Rec* for the millionth time. Leslie Knope’s energy is aspirational, but I’d settle for Ron Swanson’s nap schedule.

Woke up with that weird pit in my stomach. Not sure why—maybe the ominous coffee stain on my shirt this morning? Work was a blur of meetings where nothing was decided (shocker). Mom called and asked if I’m “seeing anyone.” Changed the subject by pretending my oven was on fire. Journaling now with the “midnight rain” candle. It’s… aggressively lavender.

Presentation at work went *okay*. Forgot to unmute twice, but my slides were decent. Team celebrated with overpriced cocktails. James from accounting told me his entire life story. Turns out he breeds exotic snails? Highlight of the day: discovering a $10 bill in my winter coat. Treating myself to takeout sushi. Mr. Whiskers approved (he got a salmon scrap).

Zero plans today. Glorious. Slept in, walked to the park, and stared at ducks for an hour. They’ve got their lives figured out. Tried to repot my sad fern—RIP, hope the compost bin treats you well. Scrolled TikTok until my brain melted. Why do I know so much about 17th-century pickling techniques now? Ordered a puzzle online. Commitment: 1000 pieces. Confidence: low.

Productive-ish Sunday? Cleaned the bathroom (gross), baked banana bread (burnt), and texted Lena a rant about Iceland’s weather. She sent back a photo of a puffin. Fair. Evening spent doomscrolling news until I panic-deleted all social apps. Replaced them with a meditation one. Lasted four minutes. Mr. Whiskers is back. We’re bonding over my inability to say no.

Rain all day. Worked from the café down the street. Barista remembered my order—does that mean I’m here too often? Ran into Alex, an old college friend. We awkwardly hugged and promised to “catch up soon.” Spoiler: we won’t. Watched a documentary about octopuses. Existential crisis: they’re smarter than me. Ended the day scribbling bad poetry in this journal. Maybe tomorrow I’ll buy a plant. Or another candle.
